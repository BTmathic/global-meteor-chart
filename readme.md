# Force Directed Graph

We display national contiguity (the connection relationship) of the countries of the world as a force directed graph. The countries are nodes and the edges (links) between them exist only if the countries share a border. The nodes are displayed with the flag of the country (via flag-sprites) and the contiguity is render from the following data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DealPete/forceDirected/master/countries.json
